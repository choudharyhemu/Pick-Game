# Pick-Game
#### In this game, we have two players. The idea is that we roll a dice. The number which is rolled on a dice gets added to the current score of active player. If the active player wants to add the current score to its total score then click on hold button and the next chance pass to the other player. If active player doesn't want to hold the points , then active player can continue.
#### Now, the thing here is that whenever we roll a one we lose all our current score and it's then the next player turn. So, thats why sometimes need to hold our points.
